subtitle: Not your average Computer Engineer
---

Hey, I'm Nick! I'm a pretty regular dude (I think) with the following interests:

- I like motorcycles (My project bike is a 1974 Honda CB550)
- I play guitar (Not very well though. I have a little Taylor GS Mini and a strat that I rotate between)
- I enjoy attempting to chef up unique recipes that I find online. In the future, you may see posts related to that here.
- Hockey is my sport of choice. Beer league is my calling.
- Running is my hobby. My goal is to complete my first marathon by the end of 2020.

While I listed all my personal interests above, I should discuss my professional interests.
As a computer engineering undergrad, I've established the following two core interets:

- Site Reliability/DevOps
- Mobile Development (Specifically iOS). Beside a brief stint assisting in the devlopment of a react-native application while at Ultimate Software, my core  

While these two interests differ wildly, my interest in both is largely due to the sizable impact that they both have on society.
When I take public transit to work each day, everyone is on their phones. So as an App Developer, I get to potentially have an impact on many lives.
The same goes for SRE/DevOps work. Scaling cloud applications to be able to reliably service millions of people at a given time 

### my history

I'm a smalltown farmboy who somehow found an captured an interest in computers at a young age. This interest led me to ultimately making the decision
to study computer engineering at the University of Waterloo. Over my time at Waterloo, I've managed to capture plenty of work experience from notable 
companies including Oracle, Ford and Apple.

While this immensely brief history summarizes the most recent years of my career, it's up to you to reach out to learn more.
