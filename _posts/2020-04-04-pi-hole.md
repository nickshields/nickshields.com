In the past several years, I've spent a lot of time configuring servers. This roughly translates to a lot of time spent in a terminal window, and plenty of time modifying files with vim. Even though I've been using vim for years now, my actual knowledge around it is minimal and my ability to use the powerful shortcuts that it comes with it rather poor. In this post, I'll show you how I've been using git for the past four years and then I'll go into some of the new more powerful features that I've learned recently that will definitely help me edit files more efficiently.

More to come soon.

Cheers!
