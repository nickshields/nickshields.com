You're going to start to see a lot of posts from me about streaming. I think this ongoing pandemic has caused me to think more about streaming technologies since it seems to be the most common way that people are killing time. This post outlines how I created and tested a basic HLS streaming server using nginx and Docker. In the coming weeks, the goal will be to have a prototype iOS app that can stream content to this server.
